# 🖐️ HAND GESTURE CONTROLLED VIRTUAL MOUSE USING PYTHON 🖥️🖱️

Control your computer mouse using only hand gestures with the help of a webcam!  
This real-time computer vision project utilizes **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **PyAutoGUI** to detect hand landmarks and map gestures to mouse movements and actions like clicking.



🚀 Features:

- 🖱️ Move mouse cursor using your hand
- 👆 Left and right click using finger gestures
- 🧠 Real-time hand tracking with webcam
- 🔧 Fully implemented in Python



📦 Technologies Used:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI
- NumPy

🖥️ How It Works:

1. The webcam captures your hand in real time.

2. MediaPipe tracks hand landmarks.
   
3. The index fingertip is mapped to screen coordinates to move the mouse.

4. When the thumb and index finger come close together, a click is triggered.
